# PacMan-Deep-Convolutional-QLearning
Deep Convolutional Q-Learning for Pac-Man playing AI using Pytorch and Gymnasium

A Deep Q-Learning Model for playing pacman using Pytorch

Using Pac-Man(MsPacmanDeterministic-v0) from Gymnasium (Atari)

Includes code to generate video implementation of model.

## Results-

Environment solved in 538 episode!

Results may vary as you run the code, but expect the environment to be solved by approximately 500 episodes.
Training takes many hours so prefer a T4 GPU hardware accelerator or higher.
